# Hi!

## To be easier to check everything that I did in this test, I chose jupyter notebook to work.
## All the libs that I used are on the top of the notebook, ready to install using pip (i just used pyspark)

## All the answers of Phases 1, 2 and 3 are inside the notebook.
<br>

## To be able to run the file you will need:

- ## Python3
- ## Jupyter notebook
- ## Spark
