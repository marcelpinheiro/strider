# Hi!

## To be easier to check everything that I did in this test, I chose a jupyter notebook to work.
## All the libs that I used are on the top on the notebook, ready to install using pip (i just used pyspark)

## All the answers of Phases 1,2 and 3 are inside the notebook.

## To be able to run the file you will need:

- ## Python3
- ## Jupyter notebook
- ## Spark
